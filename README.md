### MABs for Stohastic Shortest Path Finding

Final project for the Reinforcement Course (EBDS22218) of my research master's degree in data science.

It implements combinatorial multi-armed bandits for shortest path problem in stochastic graphs. The main implementation is in the `graphGym.py` and `agents.py` files. To see the experiments and results you can directly go to the `simulation_main.ipynb` and `results_main.ipynb`.
